JellyMix is a Jellyfin plugin that creates smart, block-based playlists from your music library. Instead of a random shuffle, JellyMix lets you control the genre mix across different sections of your playlist - perfect for parties, DJ sets, background music, or themed listening sessions.

## Features

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 🎚️ | **Genre Sliders** | Control the mix for each block with intuitive sliders (0-100%) |
| ⭐ | **Must-Have Tracks** | Search by title and artist to guarantee specific songs make the cut |
| 🔀 | **Remix Blocks** | Re-roll individual sections without regenerating the entire playlist |
| ✏️ | **Edit Anytime** | Return to saved playlists, reorder tracks, and refine your mix |
| 📤 | **Share Playlist** | Generate a beautiful printable page with blocks, genres, and track listings |
| 🎵 | **JellyMix Algorhythm** | Smart artist variety ensures no artist repeats within a block |
| 🎨 | **Smart Block Names** | Automatic themed names like "Opener", "Peak", and "Closer" |
| 📅 | **Year Filtering** | Create era-specific playlists (e.g., 1955-1970 for vintage tracks) |
| 🖼️ | **Custom Artwork** | Playlists get the JellyMix logo automatically |

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/steveshannon/jellyfin-plugin-jellymix/releases) page

5. **Configure Blocks** - Adjust genre sliders for each block's mix
6. **Conjure Playlist** - Generate your playlist preview

8. **Save** - Save to your Jellyfin library with custom artwork
9. **Share** - Generate a printable playlist page from Manage Lists

## How It Works

JellyMix divides your playlist into **blocks** - distinct sections that can each have a different genre mix. This lets you create playlists that evolve over time:

| Block | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Opener** | Start mellow with ambient or chill tracks |
| **Building** | Gradually increase energy |
| **Peak** | Hit the high point with upbeat selections |
| **Wind Down** | Ease back to a relaxed vibe |
| **Closer** | End on just the right note |

Each block's genre sliders control the probability of selecting tracks from that genre. A slider at 100 means heavy emphasis; at 0, that genre is excluded from the block.

## Requirements

- Jellyfin Server 10.11.0 or later
- Music libraries with genre metadata
